To the countless researchers, educators, and students who seek to uncover the stories hidden in data, and to those who dare to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and make the world a better place through their curiosity and determination.  

This book is also dedicated to all non-technical minds who refuse to be daunted by complexity, and to the idea that learning is a journey, not a destination.  

May this work inspire you to explore, discover, and innovate with confidence.  

And finally, to my family and loved ones, whose unwavering support and encouragement made this endeavor possibleâ€”thank you for always believing in me.
