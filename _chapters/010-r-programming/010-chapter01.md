  - Definition and use cases in research.
  - Importance of R for data analysis and visualization.
- **What is RStudio?**
  - Overview of RStudio as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
  - Benefits of using RStudio for working with R.

---

#### **2. Installing and Setting Up R and RStudio**
- **Step-by-step guide for installation:**
  - Downloading and installing R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
  - Downloading and installing RStudio from [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).
- **Quick troubleshooting tips:**
  - Resolving common installation issues.
  - Checking if R and RStudio are correctly installed.

---

#### **3. Exploring the RStudio Interface**
- **Overview of the four key panes in RStudio:**
  - **Source Pane:**
    - Writing and editing scripts.
  - **Console Pane:**
    - Interactively running commands.
  - **Environment/History Pane:**
    - Managing variables and tracking command history.
  - **Plots/Packages/Help Pane:**
    - Viewing visualizations, managing libraries, and accessing help.
- **Hands-on exploration:**
  - Running a simple command (`2 + 2`) in the Console.
  - Saving and running a script in the Source pane.

---

#### **4. Writing and Executing R Scripts**
- **What are R scripts?**
  - Difference between Console commands and Source scripts.
- **Creating and saving scripts:**
  - Writing a basic script to perform arithmetic operations.
  - Saving the script as `my_first_script.R`.
- **Running scripts:**
  - Using `source("my_first_script.R")` to execute the script.

---

#### **5. Overview of R Libraries and Packages**
- **What are R libraries and packages?**
  - The importance of packages in extending R’s functionality.
  - Base R packages vs. additional packages.
- **Installing and loading packages:**
  - Example: Installing and loading the `ggplot2` package.
- **Navigating package documentation:**
  - Using `help()` and `vignette()` to explore package features.
- **Commonly used packages for beginners:**
  - `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`.

---

#### **6. Basic Programming Constructs in R**
- **Variables and Data Types:**
  - Declaring and assigning variables (`x <- 5`, `y <- "hello"`).
  - Common data types: numeric, character, logical, and factors.
  - Checking data types with `class()` and `str()`.
- **Control Structures:**
  - **`if` Statements:**
    - Syntax and examples for conditional logic.
    ```R
    x <- 10
    if (x > 5) {
      print("x is greater than 5")
    }
    ```
  - **Loops:**
    - `for` and `while` loops for repetitive tasks.
    ```R
    for (i in 1:5) {
      print(i^2)
    }
    ```
  - **`switch` Statements:**
    - Using `switch()` for multiple conditional paths.
    ```R
    option <- "A"
    result <- switch(option,
                     "A" = "You chose A",
                     "B" = "You chose B",
                     "C" = "You chose C")
    print(result)
    ```
- **Functions:**
  - Writing and using simple functions.
  ```R
  square <- function(x) {
    return(x^2)
  }
  print(square(4))
  ```
