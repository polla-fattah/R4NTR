## Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are the backbone of programming in R. They define how information is organized, stored, and manipulated, enabling you to perform analyses efficiently and accurately. Whether you’re working with a list of numbers, tabular survey data, or a mix of text and numerical variables, data structures determine how you interact with and analyze your data.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental data structures in R, learning how to use them effectively and understanding their role in organizing information for analysis. Here are the data structures we will focus on:

- **Vectors**: The simplest and most essential data structures in R, representing a sequence of elements of the same type. Vectors form the foundation for many other structures in R and are crucial for handling simple lists of data, such as numerical results or categorical labels.

- **Matrices**: Extending vectors into two dimensions, matrices allow you to organize data into rows and columns. This structure is particularly useful for numerical operations and analyses involving grids or tables of uniform data.

- **Lists**: Unlike vectors and matrices, lists can store elements of different types, such as a combination of numbers, text, and logical values. They are incredibly flexible and often used to manage the results of complex analyses or models.

- **Data Frames**: As one of the most widely used data structures in R, data frames are ideal for storing and analyzing tabular data. With their ability to handle columns of different types, data frames are the go-to structure for handling datasets with multiple variables.

In addition to understanding these structures, we will also make them practical by learning how to import data from external sources, such as CSV or Excel files, into R. You’ll also practice exporting data back out to share your findings. Working with real-world data like the built-in `iris` dataset will give you hands-on experience and help solidify your understanding.

Once the data is imported and structured, you’ll learn to perform essential operations like indexing, subsetting, and modifying elements. These basic operations form the cornerstone of working efficiently in R, enabling you to extract meaningful insights from your data.

It’s worth noting that the majority of the data you collect or work with in research will naturally align with one of these data structures. For example, a simple list of participant ages or survey responses is best represented as a vector. Numerical datasets, such as repeated measurements across experimental conditions, fit neatly into a matrix. Results from complex analyses, which might include statistical coefficients, residuals, and diagnostics, are commonly stored in lists due to their ability to handle diverse data types. Meanwhile, datasets with multiple variables, such as survey results or experimental observations, are typically organized as data frames, where rows represent individual entries and columns correspond to variables.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll understand how these data structures underpin R programming and how they map to the kinds of data you encounter in your research. This foundational knowledge will empower you to store, manipulate, and analyze your data with confidence, setting the stage for advanced techniques later in the book.

## Importing and Exporting Data

In data analysis, tabular data is commonly stored in formats like **CSV** (Comma-Separated Values) or **Excel** files, which organize information into rows and columns. These formats are widely used for storing survey responses, experimental results, or any structured data. The first step in working with such data is importing it into R. Once imported, the data can be stored in one of R's data structures, typically a **data frame**, which is well-suited for tabular data. After analysis or modification, data can be exported back to these formats for further use or sharing.

### Importing Data

#### CSV Files

CSV files are plain-text files where values are separated by commas, making them lightweight and universally readable. The `read.csv()` function is used to import CSV files into R. For example, a file named `participants.csv` containing survey responses can be read as:

```r
# Importing a CSV file
participants <- read.csv("participants.csv")
print(participants)
```

#### Excel Files

Excel files offer additional functionality, such as multiple sheets, but require the use of a package like `readxl` for reading in R. To read an Excel file:

1. Install and load the `readxl` package:

   ```r
   install.packages("readxl")
   library(readxl)
   ```

2. Use the `read_excel()` function to load the file:

   ```r
   data <- read_excel("survey_data.xlsx", sheet = 1)
   print(data)
   ```

   <!-- expand for excel-->

### Using Built-In Datasets

R includes built-in datasets for practice and exploration. The `iris` dataset, which contains measurements for three species of flowers, is a common example. It can be loaded without importing a file:

```r
# Loading the iris dataset
data <- iris
print(head(data))
```

This dataset provides a clean and well-structured example for practicing data analysis techniques.

### Exporting Data

Exporting data ensures that processed results can be saved for further use. The `write.csv()` function is commonly used to write data frames to CSV files. For example:

```r
# Exporting a data frame to a CSV file
write.csv(data, "output_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

The `row.names = FALSE` argument prevents the inclusion of row numbers in the output, maintaining a clean format.

This process of importing and exporting data bridges the gap between data collection and analysis, enabling structured and efficient workflows. The ability to seamlessly move data into and out of R ensures compatibility with other tools and supports reproducible research practices.

## Vectors

Vectors are one of the most fundamental data structures in R. They represent a sequence of elements, all of the same type, stored in a one-dimensional array. This consistency in data type makes vectors efficient and versatile, serving as the building blocks for many other data structures like matrices, lists, and data frames.

Vectors are used to store data in a simple and organized manner, making them ideal for numerical calculations, storing categorical labels, or handling boolean conditions. Their structure allows for efficient computation and easy manipulation, which is why they form the core of most operations in R.

### Creating Vectors

Vectors in R can be created using several methods, each suited for different tasks. Below are the common approaches:

1. **Using `c()`**  

   The `c()` function combines individual elements into a single vector:  

   ```r
   numbers <- c(10, 20, 30)
   print(numbers)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   [1] 10 20 30
   ```

2. **Using `:` (Colon Operator)**  

   The colon operator generates a sequence of consecutive integers. It’s concise and widely used for simple sequences:  

   ```r
   consecutive <- 1:4
   print(consecutive)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   [1] 1 2 3 4
   ```

   This method is limited to evenly spaced integers but is quick and efficient for common use cases.

3. **Using `seq()`**  

   The `seq()` function is a more flexible alternative to `:`. It allows customization of the sequence through its parameters:  
   - **`from`**: The starting value of the sequence.  
   - **`to`**: The ending value of the sequence.  
   - **`by`**: The step size between elements (optional).  
   - **`length.out`**: The total number of elements in the sequence (optional, overrides `by`).  

   **Example of `seq()`**:  

   ```r
   # Generate a sequence from 1 to 4 with a step of 0.5
   flexible_sequence <- seq(from = 1, to = 4, by = 0.5)
   print(flexible_sequence)

    # Generate a sequence with exactly 5 elements between 1 and 4
    custom_length <- seq(from = 1, to = 4, length.out = 5)
    print(custom_length)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   [1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0
   [1] 1.00 1.75 2.50 3.25 4.00
   ```

   - `by = 0.5`: Specifies that the difference between each consecutive number is 0.5.  
   - `length.out` can be used to control the number of elements instead of `by`:  

   As it can be seen that the colon operator `:` generates evenly spaced integers (e.g., `1:4` creates `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).  `seq()` allows for greater control, including non-integer values, custom steps (`by`), or precise length (`length.out`).

1. **Using `rep()`**  

   The `rep()` function repeats values a specified number of times:  

   ```r
   repeated <- rep(5, times = 3)
   print(repeated)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   [1] 5 5 5
   ```

This updated format adds a return character before each code snippet for better Markdown compatibility, especially when copying and pasting into Markdown renderers.

### Types of Vectors

R supports different types of vectors, which determine how the data is interpreted and processed:

1. **Numeric Vectors**: Store real numbers, including decimals.

   ```r
   numeric_vec <- c(1.5, 2.3, 3.7)
   ```

2. **Character Vectors**: Store text or string data.

   ```r
   char_vec <- c("Red", "Green", "Blue")
   ```

3. **Logical Vectors**: Store boolean values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).

   ```r
   logical_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
   ```

4. **Factors**: Represent categorical data and are useful in data analysis.

   ```r
   factor_vec <- factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male"))
   ```

### Indexing and Subsetting

R provides powerful tools for accessing and manipulating specific elements of a vector:

1. **Accessing Elements Using Indices**:  
   R uses square brackets `[ ]` after a vector to indicate the index of the vector for locating specific elements or a range of elements.

   ```r
   numbers <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)
   first_element <- numbers[1]  # Extracts the first element (10)
   ```

2. **Logical Indexing for Filtering**:  
    Logical vectors, introduced in Chapter 1, can be created by applying conditions to a vector using comparison or logical operators. These vectors are then used to filter elements in a dataset by including only those that meet specified criteria.

    Logical vectors are generated by evaluating conditions such as greater than (`>`), equal to (`==`), or divisible by (`%%`). For example:

    ```r
    numbers <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40)

    # Create a logical vector for elements greater than 20
    logical_vec1 <- numbers > 20 
    print(logical_vec1)

    # Filter elements using the logical vector
    filtered1 <- numbers[logical_vec1]
    print(filtered1) 

    # Create a logical vector for elements divisible by 10
    logical_vec2 <- numbers %% 10 == 0  

    # Filter elements divisible by 10
    filtered2 <- numbers[logical_vec2]
    print(filtered2)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
    [1] 25 30 35 40
    [1] 10 20 30 40
    ```

    Logical vectors can also be used directly inside square brackets, without the need to assign them to a separate variable. This approach is more concise and is commonly used in practice. The earlier examples used variables for clarity and better understanding, but in most cases, the condition is written directly:

    ```r
    # Direct use of logical conditions for filtering

    # Filter elements greater than 20
    filtered3 <- numbers[numbers > 20]  
    print(filtered3)

    # Filter elements divisible by 10
    filtered4 <- numbers[numbers %% 10 == 0]  
    print(filtered4) 
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] 25 30 35 40
    [1] 10 20 30 40
    ```

    By directly embedding logical conditions into indexing, filtering operations become more efficient and readable. This method is widely used when clarity or variable reuse is not a concern, making it a practical approach in real-world data analysis.

### Vectorized Operations

R excels at performing operations on entire vectors without requiring explicit loops, a feature known as **vectorization**. This allows for efficient and concise data manipulation, as operations are automatically applied to each element of the vector in one step. This section explores element-wise operations, vector-to-vector operations, and the use of built-in functions.

#### Element-Wise Operations

Mathematical operations in R are applied to each element of a vector individually. This eliminates the need for manual looping and simplifies coding.

**Example**:

```r
numbers <- c(10, 20, 30)

# Multiply each element by 2
doubled <- numbers * 2
print(doubled)

# Subtract 5 from each element
subtracted <- numbers - 5
print(subtracted)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] 20 40 60
[1]  5 15 25
```

#### Vector-to-Vector Operations

When performing operations between two vectors, each element in one vector is paired with the corresponding element in the other vector.

**Example**:

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Add corresponding elements
sum_vec <- x + y
print(sum_vec)

# Multiply corresponding elements
prod_vec <- x * y
print(prod_vec)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1]  5  7  9
[1]  4 10 18
```

#### Vector Recycling

When vectors of unequal lengths are used, R performs **vector recycling**, where the shorter vector is repeated to match the length of the longer one.

**Example**:

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5)

# Add vectors of unequal lengths
recycled_sum <- x + y
print(recycled_sum)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1]  5  7  7
```

The shorter vector `y` is recycled to become `c(4, 5, 4)` before performing the addition.

#### Using Built-In Functions

R includes numerous built-in functions that operate directly on vectors, such as calculating sums, averages, and finding the maximum value.

**Example**:

```r
numbers <- c(10, 20, 30)

# Sum of elements
total <- sum(numbers)
print(total)

# Mean of elements
average <- mean(numbers)
print(average)

# Maximum value
max_value <- max(numbers)
print(max_value)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] 60
[1] 20
[1] 30
```

#### Combining Element-Wise and Built-In Functions

Element-wise operations can be combined with built-in functions for more complex tasks.

**Example**:

```r
numbers <- c(10, 20, 30)

# Double the elements and calculate their sum
doubled_sum <- sum(numbers * 2)
print(doubled_sum)

# Subtract the mean from each element
centered <- numbers - mean(numbers)
print(centered)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] 120
[1] -10   0  10
```

## Matrices

Matrices are two-dimensional data structures in R, specifically designed to store elements of the same type, such as numbers or characters. Unlike vectors, which are one-dimensional, matrices organize data in rows and columns, making them ideal for tabular data and mathematical computations.

A matrix in R is a rectangular arrangement of elements into rows and columns. All elements in a matrix must belong to the same data type (e.g., numeric, character, or logical). Matrices are widely used for tasks such as linear algebra, statistical modeling, and data manipulation, where the relationships between rows and columns are crucial.

### Creating Matrices

Matrices can be created in multiple ways, depending on the requirements of the task. The most common methods are using the `matrix()`, `cbind()`, and `rbind()` functions.

#### Using `matrix()`

The `matrix()` function creates a matrix by specifying the data, the number of rows (`nrow`), and the number of columns (`ncol`).

```r
# Create a 3x3 matrix with numbers from 1 to 9
mat1 <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
print(mat1)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    4    7
[2,]    2    5    8
[3,]    3    6    9
```

#### Using `cbind()` and `rbind()`

Matrices can also be created by combining vectors column-wise (`cbind()`) or row-wise (`rbind()`).

```r
# Column-wise binding
vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
vec2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
mat2 <- cbind(vec1, vec2)  # Combine columns
print(mat2)

# Row-wise binding
mat3 <- rbind(vec1, vec2)  # Combine rows
print(mat3)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
# mat2
     vec1 vec2
[1,]    1    4
[2,]    2    5
[3,]    3    6

# mat3
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
vec1    1    2    3
vec2    4    5    6
```

### Accessing Matrix Elements

Matrix elements are accessed using square brackets with row and column indices specified in the format `[row, column]`.

#### Accessing Specific Elements

```r
# Access the element in row 2, column 3
element <- mat1[2, 3]
print(element)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] 8
```

#### Accessing Rows and Columns

```r
# Access the first row
row <- mat1[1, ]
print(row)

# Access the second column
column <- mat1[, 2]
print(column)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] 1 4 7
[1] 4 5 6
```

### Basic Matrix Operations

R supports a variety of matrix operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose. These operations are essential for numerical and linear algebra tasks.

1. **Addition and Subtraction**

    ```r
    matA <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
    matB <- matrix(5:8, nrow = 2)

    # Addition
    mat_sum <- matA + matB
    print(mat_sum)

    # Subtraction
    mat_diff <- matA - matB
    print(mat_diff)
    ```

   **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    # mat_sum
        [,1] [,2]
    [1,]    6   10
    [2,]    8   12

    # mat_diff
        [,1] [,2]
    [1,]   -4   -4
    [2,]   -4   -4
    ```

2. **Matrix Transpose**
    The transpose of a matrix swaps its rows and columns. This is achieved using the `t()` function.

    ```r
    # Transpose the matrix
    mat_transpose <- t(matA)
    print(mat_transpose)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
        [,1] [,2]
    [1,]    1    3
    [2,]    2    4
    ```

3. **Element-Wise Multiplication**

    ```r
    # Element-wise multiplication
    mat_prod <- matA * matB
    print(mat_prod)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
        [,1] [,2]
    [1,]    5   21
    [2,]   12   32
    ```

4. **Full Matrix Multiplication**:
   Unlike element-wise multiplication, matrix multiplication combines rows of one matrix with columns of another:

   ```r
   matA <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
   matB <- matrix(c(5, 6, 7, 8), nrow = 2)

   mat_mult <- matA %*% matB
   print(mat_mult)
   ```

5. **Matrix Inversion**:
   Inverse matrices are used to solve systems of equations. The `solve()` function computes the inverse of a matrix:

   ```r
   mat <- matrix(c(2, 1, 1, 3), nrow = 2)
   mat_inv <- solve(mat)
   print(mat_inv)
   ```

6. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
   These are critical in transformations and dimensionality reduction. The `eigen()` function computes them:

   ```r
   mat <- matrix(c(4, 2, 2, 3), nrow = 2)
   eig <- eigen(mat)
   print(eig)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   # Matrix Multiplication
       [,1] [,2]
   [1,]   19   22
   [2,]   43   50

   # Matrix Inversion
       [,1] [,2]
   [1,]  0.6 -0.2
   [2,] -0.2  0.4

   # Eigenvalues
   $values
   [1] 5 2

   $vectors
    [,1]       [,2]
   [1,] 0.8944272 -0.7071068
   [2,] 0.4472136  0.7071068
    ```

## Lists

A list in R is a collection of elements stored together but without the restriction of having the same data type. Each element in a list can be named, making lists useful for organizing data and accessing it conveniently.

Lists are one of the most flexible data structures in R, capable of storing elements of different types. Unlike vectors or matrices, which require all elements to be of the same type, lists can contain a mix of data types such as numbers, characters, logical values, or even other data structures like vectors, matrices, and other lists. This versatility makes lists invaluable for handling complex data, such as the output of statistical models or results from mixed datasets.

### Creating Lists

Lists in R are highly versatile and allow you to store elements of different types within a single structure. This flexibility makes lists ideal for organizing complex data, such as mixed types of variables or nested structures. Below are the primary methods to create lists, each serving specific needs.

1. **Using `list()`**

    The most common and straightforward way to create a list is by using the `list()` function. You can include a combination of data types or structures as elements. Each element can optionally be given a name for easier reference.

    ```r
    # Creating a simple list
    my_list <- list(name = "John Doe", age = 30, scores = c(85, 90, 78))
    print(my_list)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    $name
    [1] "John Doe"
    $age
    [1] 30
    $scores
    [1] 85 90 78
    ```

2. **Coercing Other Structures to a List**

    Existing data structures, such as vectors, matrices, or data frames, can be converted into lists using the `as.list()` function. This is useful when you need to manipulate or store data in a more flexible structure.

    ```r
    # Coercing a vector to a list
    vec <- c(1, 2, 3)
    list_from_vec <- as.list(vec)
    print(list_from_vec)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [[1]]
    [1] 1
    [[2]]
    [1] 2
    [[3]]
    [1] 3
    ```

3. **Manually Creating an Empty List**

    If you need an empty list to populate later, use the `vector()` function with the `"list"` type. This method is particularly useful when the length of the list is predefined, but its elements will be added dynamically.

    ```r
    # Create an empty list
    empty_list <- vector("list", length = 3)
    print(empty_list)

    # Populate the list
    empty_list[[1]] <- "First element"
    empty_list[[2]] <- 42
    empty_list[[3]] <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
    print(empty_list)
    ```

### Modifying Lists

1. **Adding Elements**

    New elements can be added to a list by assigning a value to a new name or index.

   ```r
        # Add a new element
        my_list$city <- "New York"
        print(my_list)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    $name
    [1] "John Doe"
    $age
    [1] 30
    $scores
    [1] 85 90 78
    $city
    [1] "New York"
    ```

2. **Removing Elements**

   Remove elements by assigning `NULL` to their name or index.

   ```r
   # Remove the "age" element
   my_list$age <- NULL
   print(my_list)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    $name
    [1] "John Doe"
    $scores
    [1] 85 90 78
    $city
    [1] "New York"
    ```

3. **Combining Lists**

   Lists can be combined using the `c()` function.

   ```r
   # Combine two lists
   list1 <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
   list2 <- list(c = 3, d = 4)
   combined_list <- c(list1, list2)
   print(combined_list)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   $a
   [1] 1
   $b
   [1] 2
   $c
   [1] 3
   $d
   [1] 4
   ```

### Example: Managing a List of Students

To solidify your understanding of the lists in R and better understand its use, consider a list of students, where each student is represented by their own list containing their name, age, and grades. We'll perform dynamic operations like accessing elements using variable indices and filtering students based on their grades.

```r
# Create a list of student records
students <- list(
  student1 = list(name = "Alice", age = 21, grades = c(85, 90, 78)),
  student2 = list(name = "Bob", age = 22, grades = c(88, 76, 91)),
  student3 = list(name = "Charlie", age = 20, grades = c(92, 81, 87))
)

# Access a student's record dynamically using a variable
student_index <- "student2"
student_record <- students[[student_index]]
print(student_record)

# Extract a specific student's name
student_name <- students[[student_index]]$name
print(student_name)

# Calculate the average grade for each student and add it to their record
for (i in names(students)) {
  avg_grade <- mean(students[[i]]$grades)
  students[[i]]$average <- avg_grade
}

# Print updated student records
print(students)

# Filter students with an average grade above 85
high_achievers <- lapply(students, function(student) {
  if (student$average > 85) {
    return(student$name)
  }
})
high_achievers <- unlist(high_achievers[!sapply(high_achievers, is.null)])
print(high_achievers)

# Output only names and averages of high achievers
result <- lapply(students, function(student) {
  if (student$average > 85) {
    return(list(name = student$name, average = student$average))
  }
})
result <- result[!sapply(result, is.null)]
print(result)
```

## Data Frames

Data frames are a versatile and essential data structure in R, designed to represent tabular data with rows as observations and columns as variables. Unlike matrices, data frames allow columns to hold different data types, such as numeric, character, or logical, making them ideal for real-world datasets like survey or sales data. This structure mirrors formats like CSV files, spreadsheets, and databases, making data frames a natural choice for data analysis.

Key features of data frames include their ability to handle mixed data types, named columns for clarity, and rows that can be indexed, filtered, or grouped for analysis. They integrate seamlessly with R's tools for statistical modeling, visualization, and reporting. Nearly all datasets encountered in practice are inherently tabular, and data frames serve as a bridge between raw data and actionable insights.

Data frames are indispensable for their intuitive structure, compatibility with R's analytical functions, and versatility in handling heterogeneous data. They also facilitate easy import and export to formats like CSV and Excel, making them a powerful tool for storing and analyzing data efficiently.

### Creating Data Frames

Data frames can be created in various ways, depending on the source and structure of the data. Whether building a dataset from scratch, converting other structures, or importing data, R provides flexible tools to construct data frames efficiently.

1. **Using `data.frame()`**
    The simplest and most direct way to create a data frame is by using the `data.frame()` function. Columns are specified as arguments, and each column can have a different data type.

    ```r
    # Create a data frame from scratch
    student_data <- data.frame(
      Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
      Age = c(21, 22, 20),
      Grade = c("A", "B", "A"),
      Passed = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)
    )
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
          Name Age Grade Passed
    1    Alice  21     A   TRUE
    2      Bob  22     B   TRUE
    3  Charlie  20     A   TRUE
    ```

2. **Converting Other Structures to Data Frames**
    Existing data structures like vectors, lists, or matrices can be converted into data frames using the `as.data.frame()` function.

    ```r
    # Convert a matrix to a data frame
    mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
    df_from_matrix <- as.data.frame(mat)
    print(df_from_matrix)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
      V1 V2 V3
    1  1  4  7
    2  2  5  8
    3  3  6  9
    ```

3. **Adding Column Names While Creating Data Frames**

    Column names can be specified directly when creating a data frame or added later using the `colnames()` function.

    ```r
      # Specify column names while creating a data frame
      df_with_names <- data.frame(
        Product = c("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"),
        Price = c(1.2, 0.8, 2.5),
        Stock = c(100, 150, 50)
      )
      print(df_with_names)

      # Add column names after creation
      colnames(df_from_matrix) <- c("Column1", "Column2", "Column3")
      print(df_from_matrix)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    # df_with_names
      Product Price Stock
    1   Apple   1.2   100
    2  Banana   0.8   150
    3  Cherry   2.5    50

    # df_from_matrix with column names
      Column1 Column2 Column3
    1       1       4       7
    2       2       5       8
    3       3       6       9
    ```

4. **Creating Empty Data Frames**

    Sometimes, an empty data frame is required as a placeholder to populate later. This can be achieved using `data.frame()` without arguments or by specifying the column structure.

    ```r
    # Create an empty data frame with specified columns
    empty_df <- data.frame(
      ID = integer(),
      Name = character(),
      Score = numeric(),
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
    print(empty_df)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
      [1] ID   Name Score
      <0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)
    ```

### Accessing Data in Data Frames

Once a data frame is created, accessing and manipulating its data becomes essential for analysis. R provides multiple ways to interact with data frames, allowing for both simple and advanced operations. Understanding how to access rows, columns, and specific elements efficiently is a key step in working with data.

#### Accessing Columns

Columns in a data frame can be accessed by their names or positions. R offers several methods to achieve this:

1. **Using the `$` Operator**:
   The `$` operator is the most convenient way to access a single column by name.

   ```r
   # Access the "Age" column
   ages <- student_data$Age
   print(ages)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   [1] 21 22 20
   ```

2. **Using Bracket Notation**:
   - Single brackets `[ ]` extract one or more columns as a data frame.
   - Double brackets `[[ ]]` extract a single column as a vector.

   ```r
   # Extract the "Name" column as a data frame
   name_df <- student_data["Name"]
   print(name_df)

   # Extract the "Name" column as a vector
   name_vec <- student_data[["Name"]]
   print(name_vec)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   # name_df
      Name
   1  Alice
   2    Bob
   3 Charlie

   # name_vec
   [1] "Alice"   "Bob"     "Charlie"
   ```

#### Accessing Rows

Rows can be accessed using their numeric indices or logical conditions.

1. **Using Numeric Indices**:

   ```r
   # Access the first row
   first_row <- student_data[1, ]
   print(first_row)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
      Name Age Grade Passed
   1 Alice  21     A   TRUE
   ```

2. **Using Logical Conditions**:

   ```r
   # Filter rows where "Age" is greater than 21
   older_students <- student_data[student_data$Age > 21, ]
   print(older_students)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
      Name Age Grade Passed
   2   Bob  22     B   TRUE
   ```

#### Accessing Specific Elements

To access individual elements within a data frame, use both row and column indices.

```r
# Access the Grade of the second student
grade_second_student <- student_data[2, "Grade"]
print(grade_second_student)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] "B"
```

#### Subsetting Columns and Rows

Multiple rows and columns can be accessed simultaneously using slicing.

1. **Selecting Multiple Columns**:
  
   ```r
   # Select "Name" and "Grade" columns
   selected_columns <- student_data[, c("Name", "Grade")]
   print(selected_columns)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
        Name Grade
   1  Alice     A
   2    Bob     B
   3 Charlie     A
   ```

2. **Selecting Multiple Rows**:

   ```r
   # Select the first two rows
   first_two_rows <- student_data[1:2, ]
   print(first_two_rows)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
      Name Age Grade Passed
   1 Alice  21     A   TRUE
   2   Bob  22     B   TRUE
   ```

### Column Names and Indexing

In R, columns in a data frame are automatically assigned names based on their order or the names provided during creation. These column names are essential for referencing, manipulating, and understanding the structure of the data. This section explains how to view, set, and use column names for indexing in a data frame.

1. **Viewing Column Names**

    The `colnames()` function retrieves the current column names of a data frame.

    ```r
    # View column names of the data frame
    current_column_names <- colnames(student_data)
    print(current_column_names)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] "Name"      "Age"       "Grade"     "StudentID"
    ```

2. **Setting Custom Column Names**

    Custom column names can be assigned to provide clarity or align with the dataset's context.

    ```r
    # Set custom column names
    colnames(student_data) <- c("FullName", "Years", "GradeLevel", "ID")
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
        FullName Years GradeLevel  ID
    1        Bob    22        B+ 102
    2    Charlie    20        A+ 103
    3      Diana    23         A 104
    ```

3. **Using Column Names for Indexing**

    Column names can be used directly to access specific columns, either by name or in combination with row indexing.

    ```r
    # Access a column using its name
    student_names <- student_data[["FullName"]]
    print(student_names)

    # Access multiple columns using names
    selected_columns <- student_data[, c("FullName", "GradeLevel")]
    print(selected_columns)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] "Bob"     "Charlie" "Diana"

        FullName GradeLevel
    1        Bob        B+
    2    Charlie        A+
    3      Diana         A
    ```

4. **Resetting Column Names**

    To reset column names to default values, assign a new set of names or use `make.names()` for automatic name generation.

    ```r
    # Reset column names to default
    colnames(student_data) <- c("V1", "V2", "V3", "V4")
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
        V1 V2 V3  V4
    1    Bob 22 B+ 102
    2 Charlie 20 A+ 103
    3   Diana 23  A 104
    ```

#### Row Names and Indexing

In R, rows in a data frame are automatically indexed with numerical row numbers, but these can be customized by assigning meaningful names. Row names are particularly useful for datasets where each row represents a specific entity, such as an ID or a unique identifier. This section explains how to set, use, and reset row names in a data frame.

1. **Viewing Row Names**

    The `rownames()` function retrieves the current row names in a data frame.

    ```r
    # View row names of the data frame
    current_row_names <- rownames(student_data)
    print(current_row_names)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] "1" "2" "3"
    ```

2. **Setting Custom Row Names**

    Custom row names can be assigned to provide more context about the observations.

    ```r
    # Set custom row names
    rownames(student_data) <- c("Student1", "Student2", "Student3")
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
              Name Age Grade StudentID
    Student1    Bob  22   B+       102
    Student2 Charlie  20   A+       103
    Student3   Diana  23    A       104
    ```

3. **Using Row Names for Indexing**

    Row names can be used directly to access specific rows.

    ```r
    # Access a row using its name
    student_row <- student_data["Student2", ]
    print(student_row)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
              Name Age Grade StudentID
    Student2 Charlie  20   A+       103
    ```

4. **Resetting Row Names**

    To reset row names to their default numeric indices, use the `rownames()` function and set it to `NULL`. This operation restores sequential numeric indices as the row names. However, there are certain limitations and conditions associated with managing row names that should be considered:

    - **Uniqueness**: Row names must be unique. Attempting to assign duplicate row names will result in an error, preventing the operation from being executed successfully.

    - **Impact on Indexing**: Modifying row names does not alter the underlying numeric indices of rows. However, it may influence specific operations, such as merging data frames, where row names could be utilized for alignment. It is important to ensure that custom row names are compatible with the intended operations to avoid potential issues.

    An example of resetting row names is shown below:

    ```r
    # Reset row names to default
    rownames(student_data) <- NULL
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
          Name Age Grade StudentID
    1      Bob  22   B+       102
    2  Charlie  20   A+       103
    3    Diana  23    A       104
    ```

### Modifying Data Frames

Once a data frame is created, it often needs to be updated or expanded to include new information, remove unnecessary data, or correct values. R provides intuitive tools to modify data frames by adding, updating, or deleting rows and columns.

1. **Adding New Columns**

    To add a new column to a data frame, assign values to a new column name using the `$` operator or bracket notation.

    ```r
    # Add a new column for student IDs
    student_data$StudentID <- c(101, 102, 103)
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
          Name Age Grade Passed StudentID
    1    Alice  21     A   TRUE       101
    2      Bob  22     B   TRUE       102
    3  Charlie  20     A   TRUE       103
    ```

2. **Updating Column Values**

    Existing column values can be updated by reassigning them.

    ```r
    # Update grades for all students
    student_data$Grade <- c("A+", "B+", "A+")
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
          Name Age Grade Passed StudentID
    1    Alice  21   A+   TRUE       101
    2      Bob  22   B+   TRUE       102
    3  Charlie  20   A+   TRUE       103
    ```

3. **Removing Columns**

    Columns can be removed by setting them to `NULL`.

    ```r
    # Remove the "Passed" column
    student_data$Passed <- NULL
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
          Name Age Grade StudentID
    1    Alice  21   A+       101
    2      Bob  22   B+       102
    3  Charlie  20   A+       103
    ```

4. **Adding Rows**

    To add rows to a data frame, use `rbind()` to bind a new row.

    ```r
    # Add a new student record
    new_student <- data.frame(
      Name = "Diana",
      Age = 23,
      Grade = "A",
      StudentID = 104
    )
    student_data <- rbind(student_data, new_student)
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
          Name Age Grade StudentID
    1    Alice  21   A+       101
    2      Bob  22   B+       102
    3  Charlie  20   A+       103
    4    Diana  23    A       104
    ```

5. **Removing Rows**

    Rows can be removed by subsetting the data frame to exclude specific rows.

    ```r
    # Remove the first row
    student_data <- student_data[-1, ]
    print(student_data)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
          Name Age Grade StudentID
    1      Bob  22   B+       102
    2  Charlie  20   A+       103
    3    Diana  23    A       104
    ```

### Binding Data Frames

In many scenarios, data may be split across multiple sources or tables that need to be combined for comprehensive analysis. R provides several methods for combining data frames, whether by row binding, column binding, or merging based on common variables.

#### Row Binding with `rbind()`

The `rbind()` function binds data frames row-wise by stacking rows from one or more data frames, vectors, or matrices on top of each other. For this to work, the structures being combined must have the same columns with compatible data types.

```r
# Create a new row
new_student <- data.frame(
  Name = "Emily",
  Age = 21,
  Grade = "A",
  StudentID = 105
)

# Row bind the new row to the existing data frame
updated_students <- rbind(student_data, new_student)
print(updated_students)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
      Name Age Grade StudentID
1      Bob  22   B+       102
2  Charlie  20   A+       103
3    Diana  23    A       104
4    Emily  21    A       105
```

#### Column Binding with `cbind()`

The `cbind()` function binds data frames column-wise by appending new columns to the right of an existing data frame. To use `cbind()`, the structures being combined must have the same number of rows.

```r
# Create a new column for attendance percentage
attendance <- c(95, 88, 92)

# Column bind the new column to the data frame
students_with_attendance <- cbind(student_data, Attendance = attendance)
print(students_with_attendance)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
      Name Age Grade StudentID Attendance
1      Bob  22   B+       102         95
2  Charlie  20   A+       103         88
3    Diana  23    A       104         92
```

#### Merging Data Frames with `merge()`

The `merge()` function combines two data frames by matching rows based on one or more common columns (keys). This operation, similar to a database join, allows for precise integration of datasets that share a common identifier, such as `StudentID`. Depending on the parameters, `merge()` can perform inner joins, outer joins, left joins, or right joins.

```r
# Create another data frame with student email addresses
emails <- data.frame(
  StudentID = c(102, 103, 104),
  Email = c("bob@example.com", "charlie@example.com", "diana@example.com")
)

# Merge the email data with the main student data
students_with_emails <- merge(student_data, emails, by = "StudentID")
print(students_with_emails)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
  StudentID     Name Age Grade           Email
1       102      Bob  22   B+  bob@example.com
2       103  Charlie  20   A+ charlie@example.com
3       104    Diana  23    A diana@example.com
```

If the data frames have unequal rows, `merge()` introduces missing values (`NA`) for unmatched rows. You can control whether all rows from one or both data frames are included by using the `all.x` or `all.y` parameters.

```r
# Create a smaller data frame with partial information
partial_data <- data.frame(
  StudentID = c(102, 103),
  Scholarship = c("Yes", "No")
)

# Merge with all rows from the main data frame (left join)
combined_data <- merge(student_data, partial_data, by = "StudentID", all.x = TRUE)
print(combined_data)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
  StudentID     Name Age Grade Scholarship
1       102      Bob  22   B+         Yes
2       103  Charlie  20   A+          No
3       104    Diana  23    A         NA
```

### Operations on Data Frames

Data frames in R are not only flexible but also equipped with tools for performing various operations efficiently. These operations include sorting, filtering, and summarizing data, which are essential for data analysis.

1. **Sorting Data Frames**

    Sorting a data frame can be done using the `order()` function. This allows you to arrange rows based on the values of one or more columns.

    ```r
    # Sort the data frame by "Age" in ascending order
    sorted_by_age <- student_data[order(student_data$Age), ]
    print(sorted_by_age)

    # Sort by "Grade" in descending order
    sorted_by_grade <- student_data[order(student_data$Grade, decreasing = TRUE), ]
    print(sorted_by_grade)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    # Sorted by Age
        Name Age Grade StudentID
    2  Charlie  20   A+       103
    1      Bob  22   B+       102
    3    Diana  23    A       104

    # Sorted by Grade (Descending)
        Name Age Grade StudentID
    1      Bob  22   B+       102
    2  Charlie  20   A+       103
    3    Diana  23    A       104
    ```

2. **Filtering Rows**

    Rows can be filtered based on conditions using logical expressions.

    ```r
    # Filter students older than 21
    older_students <- student_data[student_data$Age > 21, ]
    print(older_students)

    # Filter students with Grade "A+"
    grade_a_plus <- student_data[student_data$Grade == "A+", ]
    print(grade_a_plus)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    # Students older than 21
        Name Age Grade StudentID
    3    Diana  23    A       104

    # Students with Grade "A+"
        Name Age Grade StudentID
    2  Charlie  20   A+       103
    ```

3. **Finding Dimensions**

    By Using `nrow()` and `ncol()` we can find the number of rows and columns in a data frame.

    ```r
    # Number of rows and columns
    print(nrow(student_data))  # Rows
    print(ncol(student_data))  # Columns
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] 3
    [1] 4
    ```

### Exporting Data Frames

After performing analysis or modifications on a dataset, you often need to save the results for sharing, reporting, or further processing. R allows you to export data frames into various formats, such as CSV or Excel, ensuring compatibility with other software and systems.

#### Writing Data to CSV Files

The `write.csv()` function is the simplest way to export a data frame as a CSV file.

```r
# Export the data frame to a CSV file
write.csv(student_data, "student_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Verify the file has been created
print(file.exists("student_data.csv"))
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] TRUE
```

- **Key Arguments**:
  - `row.names`: Set to `FALSE` to exclude row names in the output file.
  - `file`: Specifies the name and location of the output file.

#### Writing Data to Excel Files

If your workflow involves Excel files, the `openxlsx` package provides tools for exporting data frames to Excel format. Install the package if it's not already available.

```r
# Install the package (if needed)
# install.packages("openxlsx")

# Load the library
library(openxlsx)

# Export the data frame to an Excel file
write.xlsx(student_data, "student_data.xlsx")

# Verify the file has been created
print(file.exists("student_data.xlsx"))
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] TRUE
```

#### Including Row Names in Exports

In some cases, row names might be important and should be included in the output. To include row names in a CSV export, set the `row.names` argument to `TRUE`.

```r
# Include row names in the CSV file
rownames(student_data) <- c("Student1", "Student2", "Student3")
write.csv(student_data, "student_data_with_rownames.csv", row.names = TRUE)

# Verify the file
print(file.exists("student_data_with_rownames.csv"))
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] TRUE
```

## Indexing and Subsetting

Indexing and subsetting are fundamental techniques in R that allow precise selection and manipulation of elements within data structures. Whether working with vectors, matrices, lists, or data frames, these methods enable efficient exploration and analysis by targeting specific data points or subsets. This section explains the general rules for indexing and subsetting in R and demonstrates how to apply them using numeric, logical, and named indexing.

### General Rules for Indexing and Subsetting

1. **Indexing Starts at 1**: Unlike some programming languages (e.g., Python, which starts at 0), R indexing begins at 1.
2. **Square Brackets `[]`**: Used for selecting elements.
   - For vectors and matrices, `[]` is sufficient.
   - For lists and data frames, double square brackets `[[]]` or `$` may also be used.
3. **Negative Indices**: Exclude elements by specifying their indices with a negative sign.
4. **Logical Indices**: Use `TRUE` or `FALSE` values to filter elements.
5. **Named Indices**: Access elements by their names (if names are assigned).


### Indexing in Vectors

1. **Numeric Indexing**

    Select elements by their position.

    ```r
    # Create a vector
    numbers <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

    # Access the second element
    print(numbers[2])

    # Access multiple elements
    print(numbers[c(1, 3, 5)])
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] 20
    [1] 10 30 50
    ```

2. **Logical Indexing**

    Filter elements based on a condition.

    ```r
    # Select elements greater than 30
    filtered_numbers <- numbers[numbers > 30]
    print(filtered_numbers)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] 40 50
    ```

3. **Negative Indexing**

    Exclude specific elements.

    ```r
    # Exclude the first element
    print(numbers[-1])
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:
    ```bash
    [1] 20 30 40 50
    ```

### Indexing in Lists

1. **Accessing Elements by Name**

    ```r
    # Create a list
    my_list <- list(Name = "Alice", Age = 25, Scores = c(90, 85, 92))

    # Access element by name using $
    print(my_list$Name)

    # Access element by name using [[]]
    print(my_list[["Age"]])
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] "Alice"
    [1] 25
    ```

2. Accessing Sublist

    ```r
    # Extract a sublist
    sublist <- my_list[1:2]
    print(sublist)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    $Name
    [1] "Alice"

    $Age
    [1] 25
    ```

### Indexing in Matrices

1. **Accessing Specific Elements**

    ```r
    # Create a matrix
    mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
    print(mat)

    # Access the element in the second row, third column
    print(mat[2, 3])
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
        [,1] [,2] [,3]
    [1,]    1    2    3
    [2,]    4    5    6
    [3,]    7    8    9

    [1] 6
    ```

2. **Accessing Rows and Columns**

    ```r
    # Access the first row
    print(mat[1, ])

    # Access the second column
    print(mat[, 2])
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] 1 2 3
    [1] 2 5 8
    ```

### Indexing in Data Frames

1. **Accessing Columns**

    ```r
    # Create a data frame
    df <- data.frame(Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"), Age = c(28, 23, 34))

    # Access the "Age" column
    print(df$Age)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:
    ```bash
    [1] 28 23 34
    ```

2. **Subsetting Rows and Columns**

    ```r
    # Access the first row
    print(df[1, ])

    # Access the first two rows and the "Name" column
    print(df[1:2, "Name"])
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:
    ```bash
      Name Age
    1 John  28

    [1] "John"  "Alice"
    ```

### Named Indexing

Assign names to elements and use them for indexing.

```r
# Create a named vector
grades <- c(Math = 95, Science = 88, History = 90)

# Access the "Science" grade
print(grades["Science"])
```

**Output in R Console**:
```bash
Science 
     88 
```

### Indexing and Subsetting Example with `iris` Dataset

The following example demonstrates how to use numeric, logical, negative, and named indexing to explore and manipulate the `iris` dataset. Each operation is labeled and printed to provide a clear understanding of the indexing techniques.

```r
# Load the iris dataset
data(iris)

# 1. Numeric Indexing: Accessing specific rows and columns
print("1. Numeric Indexing: Access the first row")
print(iris[1, ])  # First row

print("Numeric Indexing: Access the first column (Sepal.Length)")
print(head(iris[, 1]))  # First column

print("Numeric Indexing: Access rows 1 to 3 and columns 2 to 4")
print(iris[1:3, 2:4])  # Subset of rows and columns

# 2. Logical Indexing: Filtering rows based on conditions
print("2. Logical Indexing: Filter rows where Sepal.Length > 6.0")
filtered_rows <- iris[iris$Sepal.Length > 6.0, ]
print(head(filtered_rows))

print("Logical Indexing: Filter rows where Species is 'setosa'")
setosa_rows <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ]
print(head(setosa_rows))

# 3. Negative Indexing: Excluding specific rows or columns
print("3. Negative Indexing: Exclude the first row")
iris_excl_first_row <- iris[-1, ]
print(head(iris_excl_first_row))

print("Negative Indexing: Exclude the first column")
iris_excl_first_column <- iris[, -1]
print(head(iris_excl_first_column))

# 4. Named Indexing: Accessing columns by name
print("4. Named Indexing: Access the 'Sepal.Length' column")
print(head(iris$Sepal.Length))  # Using $

print("Named Indexing: Access rows 1 to 3 and the 'Species' column")
subset_named <- iris[1:3, "Species"]
print(subset_named)

# 5. Combining Indexing Techniques: Complex Subsetting
print("5. Combining Indexing: Rows for 'setosa' with Sepal.Width > 3.0")
combined_filter <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa" & iris$Sepal.Width > 3.0, ]
print(combined_filter)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
1. Numeric Indexing: Access the first row
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa

...
```

## Handling Missing Data

Missing data is a common challenge in data analysis. In R, missing values are represented as `NA` (Not Available) or `NaN` (Not a Number), depending on the context. This section explains how to recognize and handle missing data effectively, ensuring the integrity of analyses and results.

### Recognizing Missing Data

R provides two types of indicators for missing data:

1. **`NA`**: Represents missing values in vectors, matrices, data frames, or lists.
2. **`NaN`**: Indicates undefined or unrepresentable numeric operations, such as `0/0`.

**Example: Recognizing Missing Values**

```r
# Create a vector with missing values
data_vector <- c(10, NA, 15, NaN, 20)

# Print the vector
print(data_vector)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] 10   NA   15  NaN  20
```

### Identifying Missing Data

To identify missing values, R provides functions like `is.na()` and `is.nan()`.

1. **Using `is.na()` to Check for Missing Data**

    ```r
    # Check for missing values
    missing_values <- is.na(data_vector)
    print(missing_values)
    ```

    **Output in R Console**:

    ```bash
    [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
    ```

2. **Using `is.nan()` to Identify NaN Values**

  ```r
  # Check for NaN values
  nan_values <- is.nan(data_vector)
  print(nan_values)
  ```

  **Output in R Console**:
  ```bash
  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
  ```

### Dealing with Missing Data

Handling missing data ensures that analyses are accurate and meaningful. R provides several methods to address missing values:

1. **Removing Missing Data**
   Use `na.omit()` to remove rows with missing values from a dataset.

   ```r
   # Create a data frame with missing values
   df <- data.frame(
     Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"),
     Age = c(25, NA, 30, 22),
     Score = c(85, 90, NA, 95)
   )

   print("Original Data Frame:")
   print(df)

   # Remove rows with missing data
   clean_df <- na.omit(df)
   print("Data Frame After Removing Missing Values:")
   print(clean_df)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   Original Data Frame:
        Name Age Score
   1    Alice  25    85
   2      Bob  NA    90
   3  Charlie  30    NA
   4    Diana  22    95

   Data Frame After Removing Missing Values:
        Name Age Score
   1    Alice  25    85
   4    Diana  22    95
   ```

2. **Replacing Missing Data**
   Replace missing values with specific values, such as the mean or median.

   ```r
   # Replace missing Age values with the mean Age
   df$Age[is.na(df$Age)] <- mean(df$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
   print("Data Frame After Replacing Missing Values:")
   print(df)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   Data Frame After Replacing Missing Values:
        Name Age Score
   1    Alice  25    85
   2      Bob  25.67  90
   3  Charlie  30    NA
   4    Diana  22    95
   ```

3. **Filtering Out Missing Data**
   Use logical indexing to exclude missing values.

   ```r
   # Filter out rows where Score is missing
   filtered_df <- df[!is.na(df$Score), ]
   print("Filtered Data Frame:")
   print(filtered_df)
   ```

   **Output in R Console**:

   ```bash
   Filtered Data Frame:
        Name Age Score
   1    Alice  25    85
   2      Bob  25.67  90
   4    Diana  22    95
   ```

## Apply and Its Sisters

Repetitive tasks are a common part of data analysis. Traditionally, loops like `for` or `while` are used to perform these tasks, but they can be verbose and computationally inefficient. The `apply()` family of functions provides an elegant and efficient alternative. These functions are designed to operate on entire data structures, such as vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames, in a concise and readable manner.

The `apply()` family improves code clarity, reduces the chance of errors, and often executes faster due to R’s internal optimizations. The key advantages of `apply()` Functions are:

- **Readability**: Reduces the complexity of explicit loops, making code concise.
- **Efficiency**: Leverages R's optimized internal mechanisms for faster execution.
- **Flexibility**: Supports built-in and custom functions, making it adaptable to various tasks.

By understanding and using the `apply()` family of functions, repetitive operations become more intuitive and efficient, particularly when working with large datasets. These functions are a cornerstone of R’s functional programming capabilities, streamlining data manipulation and computation.

### Why Use `apply()` Functions Instead of Loops?

Consider a scenario where you calculate the mean of each row in a matrix. Using a `for` loop requires several lines of code:

```r
# Example with a loop
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
row_means <- numeric(nrow(mat))  # Placeholder for results

for (i in 1:nrow(mat)) {
  row_means[i] <- mean(mat[i, ])
}
print(row_means)
```

This task can be accomplished in one line using `apply()`:

```r
# Using apply()
row_means <- apply(mat, 1, mean)
print(row_means)
```

The second approach is not only concise but also easier to read and maintain.


### 1. `apply()`: Row/Column-Wise Operations on Matrices or Data Frames

The `apply()` function is ideal for operations performed across rows or columns of a matrix or data frame.

**Syntax**:

```r
apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)
```

- **`X`**: The data structure (matrix or data frame).
- **`MARGIN`**: `1` for rows, `2` for columns.
- **`FUN`**: The function to apply.

**Example 1: Row and Column Operations**

```r
# Create a matrix
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Calculate row sums
row_sums <- apply(mat, 1, sum)

# Calculate column means
col_means <- apply(mat, 2, mean)

print("Matrix:")
print(mat)

print("Row Sums:")
print(row_sums)

print("Column Means:")
print(col_means)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
Matrix:
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
[3,]    7    8    9

Row Sums:
[1]  6 15 24

Column Means:
[1] 4 5 6
```

**Example 2: Custom Function with `apply()`**

```r
# Custom function to calculate the range (max - min) of each row
row_range <- apply(mat, 1, function(x) max(x) - min(x))
print("Row Ranges:")
print(row_range)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
Row Ranges:
[1] 2 2 2
```

### 2. `lapply()`: Operations on Lists or Vectors

The `lapply()` function applies a function to each element of a list or vector and always returns a list.

**Example: Applying a Custom Function to a List**

```r
# Create a list
my_list <- list(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6), c = c(7, 8, 9))

# Custom function to calculate the sum of squares
sum_of_squares <- function(x) sum(x^2)

# Apply the function to each element
squared_sums <- lapply(my_list, sum_of_squares)

print("Sum of Squares (as list):")
print(squared_sums)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
Sum of Squares (as list):
$a
[1] 14

$b
[1] 77

$c
[1] 194
```

### 3. `sapply()`: Simplified Version of `lapply()`

The `sapply()` function simplifies the result to a vector or matrix when possible.

**Example: Simplifying Results with `sapply()`**

```r
# Use the same function on the list
squared_sums_vector <- sapply(my_list, sum_of_squares)

print("Sum of Squares (as vector):")
print(squared_sums_vector)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
Sum of Squares (as vector):
 a   b   c 
 14  77 194 
```

### 4. `tapply()`: Grouped Operations

The `tapply()` function applies a function to subsets of data defined by a factor. It is particularly useful for grouped calculations.

**Example: Group Means**

```r

## Basic Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a foundational step in data analysis, providing insights into the structure, patterns, and characteristics of your dataset. EDA helps in identifying anomalies, understanding relationships between variables, and preparing data for advanced analysis. This section introduces key tools and techniques in R for summarizing, describing, and aggregating data.

---

### Summarizing Data

Summarizing data provides an overview of its structure and contents, helping to answer initial questions such as:

- What types of variables are present?
- What are the key statistics for numeric variables?
- Are there any missing or unusual values?

#### Using `summary()`

The `summary()` function generates an overview of each column in a data frame or matrix. It calculates statistics like the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and quartiles for numeric data, and counts for categorical data.

```r
# Summarize the iris dataset
data("iris")
print("Summary of the iris dataset:")
summary(iris)
```

**Output in R Console**:
```bash
   Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width          Species  
 Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100   setosa    :50  
 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300   versicolor:50  
 Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300   virginica :50  
 Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199                  
 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800                  
 Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500                  
```

#### Using `str()`

The `str()` function displays the structure of the dataset, including data types and a preview of each variable’s contents.

```r
# Display the structure of the iris dataset
print("Structure of the iris dataset:")
str(iris)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
'data.frame':	150 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 ...
 $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 ...
 $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 ...
 $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 ...
 $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor","virginica": 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```

#### Using `head()` and `tail()`

The `head()` and `tail()` functions provide a quick preview of the dataset by displaying the first or last few rows. By default, they show six rows, but this can be customized using the `n` argument.

```r
# View the first 6 rows of the iris dataset
print("First 6 rows of the iris dataset:")
head(iris)

# View the last 6 rows of the iris dataset
print("Last 6 rows of the iris dataset:")
tail(iris)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
First 6 rows of the iris dataset:
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa

Last 6 rows of the iris dataset:
    Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width   Species
145          6.7         3.3          5.7         2.5 virginica
146          6.7         3.0          5.2         2.3 virginica
147          6.3         2.5          5.0         1.9 virginica
148          6.5         3.0          5.2         2.0 virginica
149          6.2         3.4          5.4         2.3 virginica
150          5.9         3.0          5.1         1.8 virginica
```

### Calculating Summary Statistics

Summary statistics describe the central tendency, variability, and spread of data. These are essential for understanding data distributions and detecting anomalies.

#### Comprehensive Statistics for a Numeric Column

```r
# Calculate basic statistics for Sepal.Length
sepal_length <- iris$Sepal.Length

mean_val <- mean(sepal_length)
median_val <- median(sepal_length)
var_val <- var(sepal_length)
sd_val <- sd(sepal_length)
range_val <- range(sepal_length)
iqr_val <- IQR(sepal_length)

print(paste("Mean:", mean_val))
print(paste("Median:", median_val))
print(paste("Variance:", var_val))
print(paste("Standard Deviation:", sd_val))
print(paste("Range:", paste(range_val, collapse = " - ")))
print(paste("IQR:", iqr_val))
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
[1] "Mean: 5.84333333333333"
[1] "Median: 5.8"
[1] "Variance: 0.685693512304251"
[1] "Standard Deviation: 0.828066127977863"
[1] "Range: 4.3 - 7.9"
[1] "IQR: 1.3"
```

### Aggregating Data

Aggregation computes summary statistics across subsets of the data. This is particularly useful for comparing groups.

```r
# Aggregate Sepal.Length by Species
agg_data <- aggregate(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, FUN = mean)
print("Mean Sepal.Length by Species:")
print(agg_data)
```

**Output in R Console**:
```bash
      Species Sepal.Length
1      setosa       5.006
2  versicolor       5.936
3   virginica       6.588
```

To extend aggregation, multiple functions can be applied to summarize groups:

```r
# Aggregate multiple statistics
agg_multiple <- aggregate(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, 
                          FUN = function(x) c(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)))
print("Mean and SD of Sepal.Length by Species:")
print(agg_multiple)
```

**Output in R Console**:
```bash
      Species Sepal.Length.mean Sepal.Length.sd
1      setosa           5.006         0.3524897
2  versicolor           5.936         0.5161711
3   virginica           6.588         0.6358796
```



#### Applying Summary Statistics to Multiple Columns

R allows you to compute summary statistics for all numeric columns in a dataset simultaneously using the `summary()` function.

```r
# Summary statistics for the entire iris dataset
print("Summary of the iris dataset:")
summary(iris)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
   Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width          Species  
 Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100   setosa    :50  
 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300   versicolor:50  
 Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300   virginica :50  
 Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199                  
 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800                  
 Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500                  
```
















### Aggregating Data

Aggregation allows you to compute summary statistics for subsets of your data, often grouped by a categorical variable.

An example on Mean Sepal.Length by Species

```r
# Aggregate Sepal.Length by Species
agg_data <- aggregate(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, FUN = mean)
print("Mean Sepal.Length by Species:")
print(agg_data)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
      Species Sepal.Length
1      setosa       5.006
2  versicolor       5.936
3   virginica       6.588
```

The `~` symbol in R is used to define a formula, which specifies the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the context of `aggregate()`, it indicates that the dependent variable (on the left of `~`) should be summarized based on the levels of the independent variable (on the right of `~`).

**Example**:

```r
# Aggregate Sepal.Length by Species
agg_data <- aggregate(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, FUN = mean)
print("Mean Sepal.Length by Species:")
print(agg_data)
```

**Explanation**:

- `Sepal.Length ~ Species`: Summarize `Sepal.Length` grouped by the levels of `Species`.
- `data = iris`: Specifies the dataset to use.
- `FUN = mean`: Indicates the function to apply (mean in this case).

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
      Species Sepal.Length
1      setosa       5.006
2  versicolor       5.936
3   virginica       6.588
```

To clarify the formula syntax further:

- The left-hand side of `~` (`Sepal.Length`) is the variable to summarize.
- The right-hand side of `~` (`Species`) is the grouping variable.

You can use multiple functions to summarize the data by extending the formula notation.

```r
# Aggregate multiple statistics
agg_multiple <- aggregate(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, 
                          FUN = function(x) c(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)))
print("Mean and SD of Sepal.Length by Species:")
print(agg_multiple)
```

**Output in R Console**:

```bash
      Species Sepal.Length.mean Sepal.Length.sd
1      setosa           5.006         0.3524897
2  versicolor           5.936         0.5161711
3   virginica           6.588         0.6358796
```

This demonstrates how flexible `aggregate()` can be when analyzing data.
