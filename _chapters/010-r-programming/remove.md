Data frames are one of the most important and widely used data structures in R, especially in data analysis and research. They allow for the storage of tabular data where each column can have a different data type, making them ideal for representing datasets.

### Suggested Content for the Data Frames Section

1. **Definition and Importance**
   - What are data frames?
   - Why are data frames the backbone of data analysis in R?
   - Comparison with other tabular data structures like matrices.

2. **Creating Data Frames**
   - Using `data.frame()`.
   - Converting other structures (e.g., lists, matrices) into data frames.
   - Importing data from external files (CSV, Excel) as data frames (a connection to the "Importing and Exporting Data" section).

3. **Accessing Data in Data Frames**
   - Accessing rows, columns, and specific elements using `[]`.
   - Using column names directly with `$`.
   - Accessing subsets with logical conditions.

4. **Modifying Data Frames**
   - Adding new columns.
   - Removing columns.
   - Updating values within the data frame.

5. **Operations on Data Frames**
   - Sorting data using `order()`.
   - Filtering rows based on conditions.
   - Summarizing data using functions like `summary()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`.

6. **Combining Data Frames**
   - Using `rbind()` to combine rows.
   - Using `cbind()` to combine columns.
   - Merging data frames using `merge()`.

7. **Common Functions for Data Frames**
   - `head()` and `tail()` for previewing data.
   - `dim()` for dimensions.
   - `str()` for structure.
   - `summary()` for summary statistics.

8. **Row Names and Indexing**
   - Setting and using row names.
   - Resetting row names after filtering.

9. **Exporting Data Frames**
   - Writing data frames to external files (CSV, Excel).

10. **Practical Examples**
    - Create a small dataset representing a real-world scenario (e.g., student records, sales data).
    - Perform operations like filtering, sorting, and summarizing.
    - Show how to export the modified data frame.

11. **Comparison with Tibbles**
    - Briefly introduce tibbles (from the `tidyverse`) as a modern alternative to data frames.
