## **The Imperative of Reproducibility**

In modern data analysis, the final result—be it a statistical finding, a machine learning model, or a data visualization—is only as valuable as its credibility. The cornerstone of this credibility is **reproducibility**. Computational reproducibility is achieved when another researcher, or even your future self, can take the exact same raw data, code, and computational environment and generate the identical results, tables, and figures presented in a report.1 This is not merely an academic ideal; it is a practical necessity for ensuring scientific integrity, facilitating collaboration, and building efficient, scalable analytical workflows.

Traditional research methods often involve a fragmented, manual process. An analyst might run code in an R script, generate a plot, save it as a PNG file, and then manually insert it into a word processor. This workflow is fraught with peril. A simple copy-paste error can misrepresent a key finding. A plot can become an "orphan," disconnected from the specific code and data version that created it, making it impossible to verify or update.3 If the underlying data changes, the entire manual process of re-running code, saving outputs, and updating the document must be repeated, a tedious and error-prone task that stifles productivity.4

The solution to these challenges lies in a paradigm known as **literate programming**. Coined by Donald Knuth, this approach advocates for weaving human-readable narrative and executable source code together in a single document.6 This ensures that the final report is not a static artifact assembled by hand, but a dynamic, verifiable output generated directly from the analysis itself. In the R ecosystem, this paradigm is powerfully realized through a suite of integrated tools. R Markdown serves as the central hub for combining text and code. However, its reproducibility is only robust if the underlying computational environment is stable; this is where the

renv package becomes essential for capturing package versions.7 As an analysis evolves, version control with Git provides an auditable history of every change to both code and narrative.1 Finally, research communication can be static, like a PDF for publication, or dynamic and interactive. The R Markdown ecosystem supports both, generating professional documents via LaTeX or creating interactive dashboards with Shiny.10 Mastering these tools is not about learning four disparate skills, but about adopting a single, holistic workflow that elevates the standard of research to one that is transparent, verifiable, and efficient.

## **Dynamic Documents with R Markdown: The Hub of Reproducibility**

R Markdown is the engine of reproducible reporting in R. It provides a simple yet powerful framework for authoring dynamic documents that combine your code, its results, and your narrative analysis in one place. By automating the process of generating reports, R Markdown eliminates the manual, error-prone steps that threaten reproducibility and allows you to focus on the analysis itself.5

### **Anatomy of an.Rmd File**

At its core, an R Markdown file (with an .Rmd extension) is a plain text file. This simplicity is a key feature, making .Rmd files lightweight, portable across operating systems, and perfectly suited for version control systems like Git, which excel at tracking changes in text.11 Every

.Rmd file is composed of three fundamental types of content.

* **The YAML Header:** Every R Markdown document begins with a YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header, a control panel for your document enclosed by triple-dashes (---).12 This section contains key-value pairs that define the document's metadata and rendering options. Essential fields include  
  title, author, and date. Critically, the output field specifies the final document format, such as html\_document, pdf\_document, or word\_document.14  
* **Narrative with Markdown:** The prose of your document is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language designed for readability and ease of writing.11 Simple formatting cues are used to structure the text. For example, headers are created with hash symbols (  
  \#), with more hashes indicating a lower-level header. Text can be emphasized using asterisks for *italics* and double asterisks for **bold**. Unordered lists are created with asterisks or hyphens, and hyperlinks are formed with brackets and parentheses.6  
* **Live Analysis with R Code Chunks:** The computational engine of an R Markdown document resides within code chunks. These are blocks of R code enclosed by triple-backticks and curly braces, like \`{r}\`.13 When the document is rendered, the code within these chunks is executed, and the results—whether text, tables, or plots—are embedded directly into the final document. In addition to chunks, R allows for  
  **inline code** using single backticks and an r prefix, like \`r 2 \+ 2\`. This powerful feature allows you to embed dynamic values directly into your narrative (e.g., "The dataset contains r nrow(my\_data) observations."), ensuring that the text always reflects the latest results of the analysis.4

### **The Rendering Pipeline: From.Rmd to Polished Report**

When you click the "Knit" button in RStudio or call the rmarkdown::render() function, you initiate a sophisticated, two-stage pipeline that transforms your plain-text .Rmd file into a polished final document. Understanding this process is crucial for advanced customization and troubleshooting.12

1. **Execution with knitr:** The first stage is handled by the knitr package. knitr parses the .Rmd file and executes every R code chunk in sequential order. It captures all the output generated by the code—console text, tables, plots, and warnings—and weaves it together with the Markdown narrative. The result of this stage is an intermediate Markdown (.md) file that contains all the text and the formatted results from the R code.12  
2. **Conversion with Pandoc:** The second stage uses **Pandoc**, a powerful, universal document converter. The rmarkdown package feeds the intermediate .md file generated by knitr to Pandoc. Pandoc then converts this file into the final output format specified in the YAML header. If the output is html\_document, Pandoc generates an HTML file. If the output is word\_document, it creates a .docx file. If the output is pdf\_document, Pandoc converts the Markdown to LaTeX (.tex) and uses a LaTeX engine to produce the final PDF.6 This modular two-step process is what gives R Markdown its incredible flexibility, allowing a single source file to target dozens of different output formats.

### **Mastering Code Chunks with knitr Options**

While the default behavior of R Markdown is powerful, true mastery comes from using knitr chunk options to fine-tune the appearance and behavior of your document. These options are specified as comma-separated arguments within the curly braces of a chunk header (e.g., \`{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="My Plot"}\`) and give you precise control over every aspect of the code and its output.13

* **Controlling Code Execution and Visibility:** One of the most common tasks is controlling whether code is run and shown.  
  * eval \= FALSE: Prevents the code in the chunk from being executed. The code will be displayed in the document (if echo \= TRUE), but no results will be generated. This is useful for displaying example code in a tutorial.13  
  * echo \= FALSE: Executes the code but hides the source code from the final document. This is essential for creating reports for non-technical audiences who are interested in the results, not the underlying code.13  
  * include \= FALSE: Executes the code but includes nothing—neither the code nor its results—in the final document. This is the ideal choice for setup chunks that load libraries or data, as it performs the necessary actions without cluttering the report.13  
* **Managing Output, Messages, and Warnings:** Professional reports should be clean and free of extraneous console output.  
  * results \= 'hide': Hides the printed output from a chunk.  
  * message \= FALSE and warning \= FALSE: Prevent messages (like package startup messages) and warnings from appearing in the finished file. These are crucial for creating a polished final document.13  
  * error \= TRUE: Allows the document to finish rendering even if the code in a chunk produces an error. This is useful for debugging or for intentionally demonstrating errors in a teaching context.13  
* **Customizing Figures and Tables:** R Markdown provides extensive options for figures.  
  * fig.width and fig.height: Control the dimensions of the plot in inches.  
  * fig.align: Aligns the figure on the page (e.g., 'center', 'left', 'right').  
  * fig.cap: Provides a figure caption. For PDF and HTML outputs with a table of contents, this enables automatically numbered and cross-referenceable figures, a critical feature for academic writing.19

To ensure consistency and avoid repetition, it is a best practice to set global chunk options in the very first code chunk of your document, often named setup. Using knitr::opts\_chunk$set() in this chunk establishes defaults that will apply to every subsequent chunk in the document, which can then be overridden on a per-chunk basis if needed.19

The following table serves as a quick-reference guide to the most essential knitr chunk options and their strategic applications in creating reproducible reports.

| Option | Description | Strategic Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| eval | (TRUE/FALSE) Controls if the code chunk is executed. | Set to FALSE to display example code that should not be run. |
| echo | (TRUE/FALSE) Controls if the source code is displayed in the output. | Set to FALSE to create reports for decision-makers who only need results, not code. |
| include | (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the chunk is run but no output (code or results) is shown. | Ideal for setup chunks that load libraries and data without cluttering the report. |
| results | ('markup', 'hide', 'asis') Controls how text output is rendered. | Use 'asis' to output raw content like HTML or LaTeX directly from R code. |
| message | (TRUE/FALSE) Displays messages generated by code. | Set to FALSE to hide package loading messages (e.g., from library(tidyverse)). |
| warning | (TRUE/FALSE) Displays warnings generated by code. | Set to FALSE in final reports to avoid alarming non-technical readers. |
| error | (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the document renders even if the chunk produces an error. | Useful for debugging or creating tutorials that intentionally demonstrate errors. |
| fig.cap | ("A caption") Adds a caption to a plot. | Essential for creating numbered, cross-referenceable figures in academic papers. |
| cache | (TRUE/FALSE) Caches the results of a chunk. | Set to TRUE for computationally expensive chunks that don't need to be re-run on every knit. |

### **Multi-Format Publishing from a Single Source**

A key advantage of the R Markdown framework is the ability to generate multiple output formats from a single .Rmd source file. This is controlled in the YAML header, where you can specify different output types and customize options for each one. This capability powerfully reinforces the "write once, publish anywhere" philosophy, ensuring consistency across all versions of your report.16

For example, the following YAML header configures the document to render to both HTML and PDF, each with its own specific options for a table of contents and styling:

YAML

\---  
title: "Multi-Format Report"  
author: "Research Team"  
date: "\`r format(Sys.Date(), '%B %d, %Y')\`"  
output:  
  html\_document:  
    toc: true  
    toc\_float: true  
    theme: united  
  pdf\_document:  
    toc: true  
    highlight: zenburn  
\---

In RStudio, you can choose which format to create using the dropdown menu next to the "Knit" button. For automated workflows, you can use the rmarkdown::render() function to programmatically generate a specific format, for instance: rmarkdown::render("report.Rmd", output\_format \= "pdf\_document"). This makes it easy to integrate report generation into larger scripts or automated systems.12

## **Professional Formatting and Equations with LaTeX**

When your research requires the precise typesetting of mathematical equations or demands adherence to strict publication standards, R Markdown's ability to leverage LaTeX is indispensable. For PDF output, R Markdown uses a LaTeX engine, giving you access to the gold standard in scientific and academic publishing directly within your reproducible workflow.24

### **Typesetting Mathematics**

R Markdown makes it straightforward to embed beautifully formatted mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax. There are two primary modes for typesetting equations.26

* **Inline Equations:** For equations that appear within a line of text, enclose the LaTeX code in single dollar signs ($). For example, writing The Pythagorean theorem is stated as $a^2 \+ b^2 \= c^2$. will render the formula seamlessly within the paragraph.  
* **Display Equations:** For more complex equations that should be centered on their own line, enclose the LaTeX code in double dollar signs ($$). For instance:  
  Code snippet  
  The formula for the standard deviation is:  
  $$\\sigma \= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum\_{i=1}^N (x\_i \- \\mu)^2}$$

  This will produce a professionally centered and formatted equation, distinct from the surrounding text.

LaTeX supports a vast library of commands for virtually any mathematical structure. Key examples include:

* **Fractions:** \\frac{numerator}{denominator} produces a fraction, like $\\frac{a}{b}$.  
* **Superscripts and Subscripts:** Use ^ for superscripts and \_ for subscripts. For multi-character exponents or indices, group them with curly braces: $x\_{ij}^2$ renders as xij2​.24  
* **Common Symbols and Functions:** Commands exist for nearly every symbol, including Greek letters (\\alpha, \\beta, \\Sigma), roots (\\sqrt{...}), and operators like summation (\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}) and integrals (\\int\_{a}^{b}).24  
* **Matrices and Aligned Equations:** For more complex structures, LaTeX environments are used. The pmatrix environment creates a matrix with parentheses, while the align\* environment allows for aligning multiple equations at a specific character (typically \=), which is invaluable for showing step-by-step derivations.26

The following table provides a quick reference for some of the most common LaTeX mathematical symbols.

| Symbol | Command | Symbol | Command | Symbol | Command |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| α | \\alpha | β | \\beta | γ | \\gamma |
| ∑ | \\sum | ∫ | \\int | ∞ | \\infty |
| ≤ | \\leq | ≥ | \\geq | \= | \\neq |
| × | \\times | ± | \\pm | → | \\rightarrow |

### **Advanced PDF Customization**

To move beyond the default template and create a PDF that meets specific formatting requirements (e.g., for a journal submission or a thesis), you can leverage the full power of LaTeX's package ecosystem. This is done by adding LaTeX commands and package imports to the YAML header using the header-includes field. This allows you to customize everything from page margins and fonts to headers and footers.28

For example, to create a document with custom margins, Times New Roman font, and custom page headers, you could use the following YAML configuration:

YAML

\---  
title: "Professionally Formatted Report"  
output:  
  pdf\_document:  
    latex\_engine: xelatex  
header-includes:  
  \- \\usepackage{geometry}  
  \- \\geometry{left=1in, right=1in, top=1in, bottom=1in}  
  \- \\usepackage{fontspec}  
  \- \\setmainfont{Times New Roman}  
  \- \\usepackage{fancyhdr}  
  \- \\pagestyle{fancy}  
  \- \\fancyhead\[L\]{My Research Project}  
  \- \\fancyhead{\\thepage}  
  \- \\renewcommand{\\headrulewidth}{0.4pt}  
\---

This example loads the geometry package to set page margins, the fontspec package (requiring the xelatex engine) to change the font, and the fancyhdr package to create custom headers. This level of control demonstrates that R Markdown is not a limited system but a gateway to the full capabilities of professional typesetting systems.28

## **Building Interactive Applications with Shiny**

While R Markdown is perfect for creating static, reproducible reports, sometimes the best way to communicate results is to let your audience explore the data themselves. **Shiny** is an R package that makes it remarkably easy to build interactive web applications and dashboards directly from R, requiring no prior knowledge of web development languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.30

### **The Core Architecture: UI and Server**

Every Shiny application is built from two fundamental components, typically saved together in a single file named app.R.30

1. **The ui (User Interface):** This is an R object that defines the layout and appearance of your web application. You construct the ui using a family of R functions that generate the necessary HTML. Core layout functions like fluidPage() and sidebarLayout() create the overall structure. Within this structure, you add **input controls** (or "widgets") like sliderInput(), selectInput(), and textInput() that allow the user to provide input, and **output elements** like plotOutput() and textOutput() that act as placeholders for results generated by R.33  
2. **The server function:** This is an R function that contains the instructions for building the application's outputs from its inputs. The server function always takes at least two arguments: input and output. The input object is a read-only list that contains the current values of all the input controls from the ui. The output object is a list that you populate with render functions (e.g., renderPlot(), renderText()) to tell Shiny how to build the R objects to display in the output placeholders.33

The application is brought to life by calling shinyApp(ui, server) at the end of the app.R file.30

### **The Magic of Reactivity**

The power of Shiny lies in its **reactivity** model. This is a programming paradigm that automatically establishes dependencies between inputs and outputs. When a user changes an input—for example, by moving a slider—Shiny automatically detects this change and re-runs only the specific pieces of code needed to update the outputs that depend on that input.30

This process is fundamentally different from a traditional R script that runs from top to bottom. In Shiny, the order of execution is not determined by the order of lines in your server function, but by a **reactive graph** that maps the dependencies between components.37 This represents a mental shift from an

*imperative* style of programming ("do this, then do that") to a *declarative* style ("this output depends on that input"). The developer's role is to define these relationships correctly, and Shiny handles the execution.

To manage this reactive flow efficiently, Shiny provides **reactive expressions**. Created with the reactive() function, these are expressions whose results are cached. A reactive expression only re-executes when the inputs it depends on have changed. This is crucial for performance, as it prevents slow or computationally expensive operations (like loading a large dataset or fitting a model) from being re-run every time a minor input (like a plot color) is changed.30

### **Your First Interactive Dashboard**

Building a simple Shiny app is the best way to understand these concepts. The following code creates a complete application that visualizes the mtcars dataset. The ui defines a sidebar with a dropdown menu (selectInput) to choose a variable and a main panel with a placeholder for a plot (plotOutput). The server function uses renderPlot to create a histogram of the variable selected by the user, which it accesses via input$variable.

R

\# Load the shiny library  
library(shiny)

\# Define the User Interface (UI)  
ui \<- fluidPage(  
    \# Application title  
    titlePanel("MTCars Dataset Explorer"),

    \# Sidebar layout with input and output definitions  
    sidebarLayout(  
        \# Sidebar panel for inputs  
        sidebarPanel(  
            \# Dropdown menu to select a variable  
            selectInput(inputId \= "variable",  
                        label \= "Choose a variable to display:",  
                        choices \= names(mtcars),  
                        selected \= "mpg")  
        ),

        \# Main panel for displaying outputs  
        mainPanel(  
            \# Output: Histogram  
            plotOutput(outputId \= "histPlot")  
        )  
    )  
)

\# Define the Server logic  
server \<- function(input, output) {  
    \# Render the histogram  
    output$histPlot \<- renderPlot({  
        \# Create a histogram of the selected variable  
        hist(mtcars\[\[input$variable\]\],  
             main \= paste("Histogram of", input$variable),  
             xlab \= input$variable,  
             col \= "skyblue",  
             border \= "white")  
    })  
}

\# Run the application  
shinyApp(ui \= ui, server \= server)

When this app.R file is run, it launches a web application where changing the selection in the dropdown menu instantly and automatically updates the histogram. This simple example encapsulates the core architecture and reactive magic of every Shiny app.

## **Weaving It All Together: Interactive Documents**

The true power of the R ecosystem is revealed when tools are combined. R Markdown and Shiny can be seamlessly integrated to create **interactive documents**—reports that are not just static summaries but live applications where readers can explore data, change parameters, and see results update in real time. This bridges the gap between reproducible reporting and interactive data exploration.

### **From Static to Dynamic: runtime: shiny**

Transforming a standard R Markdown document into an interactive one is remarkably simple. All that is required is adding a single line to the YAML header: runtime: shiny.10 This tells

rmarkdown to treat the document not as a file to be "knitted" into a static output, but as the source for a live Shiny application.

YAML

\---  
title: "Interactive Document"  
output: html\_document  
runtime: shiny  
\---

When RStudio detects this runtime, the "Knit" button on the editor toolbar automatically changes to "Run Document." Clicking this button launches the document as a web application, with a live R session running in the background to power the interactive components.10 This feature only works with HTML-based output formats, as interactivity is not possible in static formats like PDF or Word.

### **Embedding Shiny Components in R Markdown**

Once runtime: shiny is enabled, you can embed individual Shiny input widgets and output elements directly within your R Markdown file. The input functions (e.g., sliderInput(), selectInput()) are placed in standard R code chunks. The corresponding outputs (e.g., plotOutput(), textOutput()) are also placed in code chunks, and their rendering logic is defined within the document using the standard render\* functions.4

This allows you to create reports where the narrative flows around interactive elements. For example, you could write a paragraph explaining a regression model, followed by a slider that allows the reader to adjust a coefficient, with a plot below it that reactively updates to show the effect of the change.

R

\---  
title: "Interactive Regression Analysis"  
output: html\_document  
runtime: shiny  
\---

This document analyzes the relationship between car weight and fuel efficiency. We can fit a simple linear model. Use the slider below to adjust the slope of the regression line.

\`\`\`{r, echo=FALSE}  
sliderInput("slope", "Slope (mpg/1000 lbs):", min \= \-10, max \= 0, value \= \-5, step \= 0.1)

Code snippet

renderPlot({  
  plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, xlab \= "Weight (1000 lbs)", ylab \= "Miles per Gallon")  
  abline(a \= 37, b \= input$slope, col \= "red", lwd \= 2\)  
})

\#\#\# Embedding Full Shiny Apps

For more complex interactivity, it is often better to embed a complete, self-contained Shiny app within an R Markdown document. This keeps the UI and server logic for the interactive component neatly encapsulated. There are two primary methods for achieving this.\[39\]

1\.  \*\*Inline Definition:\*\* You can define a full Shiny app (both \`ui\` and \`server\`) directly inside a single R code chunk using the \`shiny::shinyApp()\` function. This is convenient for small, simple apps.\[39, 40\]

2\.  \*\*External Application:\*\* For better organization and modularity, you can build your Shiny app in its own directory (with an \`app.R\` file) and then embed it into your document using the \`shiny::shinyAppDir()\` function. This function takes the path to the app's directory as an argument.\[39, 40\]

When embedding full apps, it is a crucial best practice to use the chunk option \`echo \= FALSE\`. This ensures that only the interactive Shiny application is displayed in the final document, hiding the underlying code that defines it.\[39, 40\]

\#\# Best Practices for a Complete Reproducible Workflow

The tools of R Markdown, LaTeX, and Shiny provide the components for reproducibility, but true, robust reproducibility is a product of a disciplined workflow. Adopting best practices for project organization, version control, and dependency management transforms these components into a seamless and powerful system for conducting and communicating research.

\#\#\# Project Organization and Version Control with Git

A reproducible project must be self-contained. The best way to achieve this is by using \*\*RStudio Projects\*\*. Creating a project for each analysis encapsulates all related files—data, code, reports, and outputs—into a single directory. This automatically sets the working directory to the project's root, eliminating a common source of errors and making the project portable to other machines.\[41, 42\] A well-organized project typically uses subdirectories, such as \`/data\` for raw data, \`/R\` for scripts and functions, and \`/reports\` for the final outputs.

To track the evolution of an analysis, \*\*version control\*\* is essential. \*\*Git\*\* is the industry standard for version control, and RStudio provides excellent integration. By initializing a Git repository within an RStudio Project, you can track every change to your text-based files (\`.R\`, \`.Rmd\`). The basic workflow involves:  
1\.  \*\*Staging\*\* changes you want to save.  
2\.  \*\*Committing\*\* those changes with a descriptive message.  
3\.  \*\*Pushing\*\* your commits to a remote repository on a platform like GitHub for backup and collaboration.\[1, 9, 42\]

\#\#\# Bulletproof Dependencies with renv

A critical and often overlooked threat to reproducibility is the computational environment. R's default behavior of installing packages into a single, shared user library means that updating a package for one project can inadvertently break the code for another.\[7\]

The \`renv\` package provides a robust solution by enabling project-specific, isolated libraries. It ensures that each project has its own set of packages, making the project's dependencies explicit and portable.\[8, 43\] The \`renv\` workflow is centered around three key functions:

1\.  \`renv::init()\`: This function is run once per project. It creates a private project library and scans your R scripts to discover package dependencies, installing them into the new library. It also creates a lockfile, \`renv.lock\`.\[43, 44\]  
2\.  \`renv::snapshot()\`: After installing, updating, or removing packages, you run this function to save the exact state of your project's library—including the specific version of every package—to the \`renv.lock\` file.\[7\]  
3\.  \`renv::restore()\`: When you or a collaborator opens the project on a new machine, this function reads the \`renv.lock\` file and installs the exact versions of all required packages, perfectly recreating the original computational environment.\[43, 45\]

The \`renv.lock\` file is the blueprint of your environment and should always be committed to Git along with your code. This practice ensures that anyone who clones your repository can fully reproduce not just your code, but the environment needed to run it.\[7, 8\]

\#\#\# A Capstone Workflow

Synthesizing these tools and practices yields a comprehensive workflow for starting any new research project. This checklist provides a clear path to ensuring your work is organized, version-controlled, and fully reproducible from day one.

1\.  \*\*Initialize the Project:\*\* Create a new \*\*RStudio Project\*\* and immediately initialize a \*\*Git\*\* repository to begin tracking changes.  
2\.  \*\*Isolate the Environment:\*\* Run \`renv::init()\` to create a project-specific library and lockfile for dependency management.  
3\.  \*\*Organize Files:\*\* Create a logical directory structure within your project (e.g., \`/data\`, \`/R\`, \`/reports\`).  
4\.  \*\*Develop the Analysis:\*\* Write your code and narrative together within an \*\*R Markdown\*\* (\`.Rmd\`) file.  
5\.  \*\*Format Professionally:\*\* Use \`knitr\` chunk options to control the output and integrate \*\*LaTeX\*\* for mathematical equations as needed.  
6\.  \*\*Add Interactivity (Optional):\*\* If beneficial, add \*\*Shiny\*\* components to your R Markdown document to create interactive reports or dashboards.  
7\.  \*\*Track Progress:\*\* Regularly commit your changes with descriptive messages using Git. After any changes to packages, update your environment's blueprint with \`renv::snapshot()\`.  
8\.  \*\*Share and Collaborate:\*\* Push your project repository to a platform like GitHub. A collaborator can then clone the project, run \`renv::restore()\` to build the identical environment, and reproduce your entire analysis with a single click of the "Knit" button.

By following this workflow, you move beyond simply writing code to producing a complete, self-contained, and verifiable research compendium—the true standard for modern, reproducible data science.\[41, 42, 46, 47\]
